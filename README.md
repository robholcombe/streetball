Note: Abandoned since early 2017.

Has not been tested with recent versions and would be missing model assets (LFS), so consider this a code-only repo for reference only.
Useful scripts: /Assets/Scripts/PlayerShoot.cs (trajectory physics script)

* Git + LFS [help here](http://en.joysword.com/posts/2016/03/setting_up_github_for_unity_projects/)
